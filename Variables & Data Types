# 🐍 Python 101 for Hackers – Variable Demo

Welcome! This repository is part of my learning journey through **Python 101 for Hackers** by TCM Academy.  
This script demonstrates how **Python variables** work and introduces basic data types in a way that even non-technical readers can understand.

## 🔍 What This Script Does

This script is all about **variables**—which are like labeled boxes where we store data.  
In Python, we can store different kinds of things like names, numbers, lists, or even True/False values.

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Breakdown

```python
name = "neut"
print(name)
📦 We create a variable called name and store the word "neut" in it. Then, we print it.

python
Copy
Edit
name_length = 4
print(name_length)
📦 We store the number 4 in a variable called name_length.

python
Copy
Edit
name, name_length = "neut", 4
✨ We assign values to two variables at once.

python
Copy
Edit
print(type(name))
print(type(name_length))
🔍 We check what kind of data each variable holds:

name is a string (text)

name_length is an integer (number)

python
Copy
Edit
name_length = int("4")
print(type(name_length))
🔁 We convert the string "4" into a number using int().

python
Copy
Edit
name_length = 4
Name_length = 5

print(name_length)
print(Name_length)
⚠️ Python is case-sensitive! name_length and Name_length are different variables.

python
Copy
Edit
name_list = ["neut", "247CTF", "asd"]
print(type(name_list))
🗂️ We create a list—a collection of multiple values.

python
Copy
Edit
name1, name2, name3 = name_list
print(name1)
print(name2)
print(name3)
🧩 We split the list into three separate variables.

python
Copy
Edit
name_tuple = ("neut", "247CTF")
print(type(name_tuple))
🔒 A tuple is a fixed collection of values. We can’t change it after it's created.

python
Copy
Edit
name_boolean = True
print(type(name_boolean))
✅ A Boolean is a value that is either True or False.

python
Copy
Edit
name_range = range(6)
print(type(name_range))
📈 A range represents numbers from 0 up to (but not including) 6.

python
Copy
Edit
name_bytes = b"neut2"
print(type(name_bytes))
💾 Bytes are raw data. Used in hacking, file manipulation, and networking.

python
Copy
Edit
name_dictionary = {"neut": 4, "247CTF": 6}
print(type(name_dictionary))
📚 A dictionary stores data in key-value pairs, like a mini database.

python
Copy
Edit
print(name_tuple)
print(name_list)
print(name_dictionary)
print(name_boolean)
print(name_range)
print(name_bytes)
🖨️ Finally, we print out all the different types of variables we've created.

🧩 Summary
In this script, we learned about:

str: Strings (text)

int: Integers (numbers)

list: Editable collections

tuple: Unchangeable collections

bool: True/False values

range: Sequences of numbers

bytes: Raw binary data

dict: Key-value storage

This is the foundation of Python programming and sets the stage for writing real hacking tools.
