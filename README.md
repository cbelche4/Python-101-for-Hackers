# Python for Hackers – Learning Journey

Welcome to my raw notes and code examples as I work through **TCM Security's Python 101 for Hackers** course. This repository is a collection of my hands-on practice, reflections, and mini-projects as I develop Python skills tailored for ethical hacking and cybersecurity.

## 📘 About the Course

**Python 101 for Hackers** by TCM Academy is designed to teach Python from the ground up, with a focus on how it can be used in offensive security. Topics include:

- Python basics
- File I/O
- Sockets and networking
- Building simple tools like port scanners and keyloggers
- Automating tasks for penetration testing

## 🎯 My Goal

My goal with this repository is to:

- Document my progress
- Solidify my understanding of each topic
- Build a portfolio of practical Python scripts geared towards cybersecurity and ethical hacking
- Serve as a reference for myself and others interested in the same path

## 🛠️ Tools and Environment

- Python 3.x
- VS Code / Kali Linux / Ubuntu
- Common Python libraries (socket, os, subprocess, etc.)
